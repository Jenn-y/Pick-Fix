# Pick&Fix Idea

>Finding a professional for an in-house service has never been harder. With numerous
>e-commerce websites growing day by day with vast offer, search of a professional for the right
>service becomes more and more time-consuming and with a lack of comparison. Pick&Fix
>offers solutions to mentioned constraints by connecting offers and demands in one place with
>a clear track and review of all information. There are 2 types of roles for the Pick&Fix users: a
>professional and a client. Professionals define their work offers: types of services, cities offered
>for service and charge per hour, while clients browse all professionals according to their needs
>and choose the right one with the help of rating, price and review comments. Apart from
>interacting with one another, these 2 roles can at any point be interlaced, where a client becomes
>a professional by offering their work and a professional becomes a client of another
>professional. 
>
>With Pick&Fix, the clients are guaranteed to save time and have a clear work
>offer comparison, while professionals gain experience and expand their businesses with a well
>targeted group of clients.
